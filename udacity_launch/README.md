To log data in sperate bagfiles and compressed image
====================================================
```
roslaunch udacity_launch logging.launch bagPath:="/media/Data/UdacitySDC/udacity-datasetN"
```


To convert existing log to sperate bagfiles and compressed image
================================================================
```
rosbag  play --clock old_single_huge_bagfile.bag
roslaunch udacity_launch logging.launch republish_raw2compressed_images:=true bagPath:="/media/Data/UdacitySDC/udacity-datasetN"
```


Compressed bagfiles
================================================================
Each of the bagfiles are already compressed, so there is no benifit
of compressing the folders to compressed file other than having a single file
for the whole folder.
The bagfiles decompress on the fly and may cause slower performance and you
may want to decompress them before you run, size would increase by around 10% only.
```
$rosbag decompress *.bag
```
